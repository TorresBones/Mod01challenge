# Code Refactor

## Description

In this work I refactored a company page, consolidating and organizing the code, both HTML and CSS. I found it fun, although a little confusing because of so many <div> elements, but at the end I learned a lot and I know that I will use it in my future career just to make work easier for my coworkers.

## Usage

I added comments on the changes I made so that anyone who see at this work can understand what I did and how I decided to arrange the files.
